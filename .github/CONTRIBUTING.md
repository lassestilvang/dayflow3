# Contributing to Dayflow Planner

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Dayflow Planner! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 or higher
- pnpm 8 or higher
- Git

### Setup

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
4. Copy environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```
5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-fix-name
```

### 2. Make Changes

- Follow the existing code style and conventions
- Write tests for new functionality
- Update documentation if needed

### 3. Run Tests and Checks

```bash
pnpm lint          # Check code style
pnpm type-check    # TypeScript type checking
pnpm test          # Run unit tests
pnpm test:e2e      # Run E2E tests
pnpm build         # Ensure build succeeds
```

### 4. Commit Changes

Use conventional commits:

```
feat: add new feature
fix: resolve bug
docs: update documentation
style: code formatting changes
refactor: code refactoring
test: add or update tests
chore: maintenance tasks
```

### 5. Push and Create Pull Request

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

## Code Style Guidelines

### TypeScript

- Use strict TypeScript mode
- Provide explicit types for function parameters and return values
- Prefer interfaces over types for object shapes
- Use `const` assertions for readonly objects

### React Components

- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow the existing component structure
- Use `cn()` utility for conditional Tailwind classes
- Implement proper error boundaries

### CSS/Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS classes
- Follow the existing design system
- Use responsive design patterns
- Ensure accessibility (ARIA labels, semantic HTML)

### Testing

- Write unit tests for new features
- Test components with React Testing Library
- Use Playwright for E2E tests
- Aim for high test coverage
